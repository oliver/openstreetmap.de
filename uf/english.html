    	<h1>The EU Copyright Directive will harm OpenStreetMap</h1>
  	</div>

        <h2 id="why_black">Why do I see these black squares?</h2>
	<p>On 12 September 2018, the plenary of the European Parliament will <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=AGENDA&reference=20180912&secondRef=SIT&language=EN">vote</a> a second time on the new EU Copyright Directive. The article 13 of that new directive introduces the requirement for content platforms on the internet to scan content submitted by their users for potential copyright violations. OpenStreetMap would have to add such filters. This threatens our project.</p>

        <h2 id="why_political">Why do you use the map for your political statements?</h2>
	<p>We do not do this deliberately. We think that carelessly passing of draft by the European Parliament would harm the OpenStreetMap substantially. Black map tiles would not be the result but we would have an OpenStreetMap which spend more resources on pre-filtering of content than on anything else – the project would be a shadow of its former self. If nothing changes, a dark future expects us.</p>

	<p>The <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenStreetMap Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.fossgis.de/">FOSSGIS e.V.</a>, the official local chapter in Germany, campaign for free map data. We usually do so in financial and technical matters but sometimes we are forced to become active in politics to defend the project.</p>


        <h2 id="what_is_osm">What is OpenStreetMap?</h2>
	<p>OpenStreetMap is a international project founded in 2004 to create a free map of the world. To do so, we, thousands of volunteers, collect data about roads, railways, rivers, forests, buildings and a lot more worldwide. Our map data can be downloaded for free by everyone and used for any purpose – including commercial usage. It is possible to produce your own maps which highlight certain features, to calculate routes etc.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, OpenStreetMap is used increasingly where up to date and easily to improve maps are required: ambulance services, fire brigades, humanitarian development and humanitarian crises response.</p>

        <h2 id="why_harm">Why do upload filters harm OpenStreetMap?</h2>
	<p>The OpenStreetMap project emphasizes openness. Map changes by new users are applied on the database immediately and are provided to other data processors via download interfaces. Therefore, the map is always as up to date as possible.</p>
	<p>Upload filter are very impracticable for multiple reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OpenStreetMap captures the reality as it is. Other map providers do the same. If OpenStreetMap compared the submissions with other datasets, many false positives would occur. Our data is if it is correct, very similar to the data of other map providers. A road in OpenStreetMap has the same curves, the same name, the same speed limit. It will be even more difficult if it comes to points of interests such as shops, restaurants etc. These facilities are usually entered by their owners into the databases of multiple map providers. Should every data provider reject the submission because another provider has received the information yet?</li>
            <li>If a user uploads a change which is caught by a filter due to the suspicion, the change has to be reviewed soon. This requires our volunteers who would like to improve the map than to check if a filter returned a false positive.</li>
            <li>If a withhold contribution and the contribution of another user edit the same object in the database, an editing conflict occurs. They cannot be solved automatically because our world is too complex. Some conflicts are not even obvious: If two users enter the same new building, both create a new object in the database. No conflict is detected and the building appears twice in the database.</li>
            <li>If the filter withholds the contribution by a new user although the contribution is good, the contributor looses its motivation to contribute more because the positive feedback is missing.</li>
            <li>The development, installation and optimisation of this filter would consume a lot of work of our volunteer software developers. We might have to invest money to hire developers. Both the work of the volunteers and the donations are required for other parts of our project where we have to keep up with the technical development in order not to get lost.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="wikipedia">But there is an exemption for Wikipedia, isn't it?</h2>
        <p>It is not clear whether the "Wikipedia exemption" would be valid for OSM and even Wikipedia does not feel confident: María Sefidari Huici,  member of the board of Wikimedia Foundation, calls the proposed changes a threat for the living and free internet. The Wikimedia Foundation, the organisation behind Wikipedia, <a href="https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/your-internet-is-under-threat-heres-why-you-should-care-about-european-copyright-reform-7eb6ff4cf321">doubts</a> that this exemption satisfies the requirements. We join this doubts.</p>
        <p>The directive has to be implemente by the members of the European Union into national law. This implementation does not look equally across all countries. Some differences are possible. For example, the term "commercial" is interpreted quite strict in Germany. Our map data is used commercially. There is a whole series of companies which use our data and contribute back to OpenStreetMap by developing open source software, employing map data contributors or just by making OpenStreetMap accessible to the broad public. If OpenStreetMap is made unusable for commercial actors by the back door, it harms everyone of us.</p>

        <h2 id="stupid_idea">Why are upload filters a stupid idea?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Absurd reversal of the burden of proof</b> The requirement to ensure the legality of uploaded content by the operator on their cost puts them under suspicion and reverses burden of proof.</li>
            <li><b>Absurd disparity of means</b> To catch a small number of copyright violations, the liberty of everyone is limited. How should a press article be discussed if it is not permitted to cite small snippets?</li>
            <li><b>Wrong decision in case of doubt</b> The requirement to refrain from publication in case of doubt instead of permitting it, contradicts the established principle "in dubtio pro reo" and cuts personal freedom. Content will be sorted out if a small suspicion exists that they could violated rights of someone else.</li>
            <li><b>Disadvantage of small competitiors</b> Small platforms with a small budget are forced to purchase the required filters from large software monopolists. It is more than just a significant financial discrimination. It makes them dependent from their competitiors in financial and legal terms and destroys an innovative and free market.</li>
            <li><b>Unequal treatment</b> The intention to exempt "desirable services" such as Wikipedia declares all others to "undesirable services" and leads to censorship. Who will decided what is desired and what not?</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="help">What can I do against the directive?</h2>
        <p>The website <a href="https://www.saveyourinternet.eu/">www.saveyourinternet.eu</a> gives assistence to get in touch with your member of parliament. If we succeed to convine enough members that the upload filters described in article 13 of the proposal are a stupid idea, the parliament can reject the article – or even the whole draft.</p>

        <h2 id="no_black">How can I get around the black map tiles?</h2>
        <p>It is not possible (it is implemented on server side). But we will restore the old functionality in a few days.</p>
        <p>The raw map data is not affected.</p>
